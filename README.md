# SyncSwap Token Icons

Token icons for the SyncSwap interface.

## Formats

The icons for each token are stored under folders named with their contract address in lowercase. Icon files can be accessed through the GitHub user content.

The icon should be in PNG format with a recommended size of 200x200. Generally, icons larger than 200x200 size will not be accepted.

## Submit your logo

You can open a Pull Request to submit your token logo.

For a better UX, icon files should be kept as small as possible while not compromising the image quality. It would help if you used tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress the files before submitting.

- Create a folder under `tokens` named with the token address in lowercase.
- Optionally, compress your logo to reduce the file size.
- Put your `logo.png` file inside the token folder. See above for the file format.

PRs should be reviewed within a few days. Join our Discord community if you need further help.
